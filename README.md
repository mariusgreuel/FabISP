# FabISP, a fab-able in-system programmer

This is a fork of the [FabISP firmware](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/content/archive/projects/fabisp/) by David A. Mellis, which is based on USBtiny by Dick Streefland.

The goal of this fork is to add support for WinUSB to FabISP firmware to eliminate the need for third-party USB drivers in Windows, such as libusb0.
